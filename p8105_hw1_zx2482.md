The scatterplot shows the variability of temperatures from January 1st
to 15th at three major airports in the New York area. The fluctuations
on the graph indicate that the temperature rises and falls throughout
the day. Overall, this chart shows a slightly upward trend, implying the
temperature might have increased during January 1-15.The humidity
throughout the month is primarily between 40-80%, but from approximately
January 12th to 14th, the humidity is noticeably higher than usual,
reaching 90-100%.
